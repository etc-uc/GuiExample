# GuiExample

This is a small example project, continuously developed to show some basic functionality and workflow of Embedded Wizard.
The example is created for the STM32F746G-Discovery board, and assumes the build environment for this board
to be installed in the C:\STM32\STM32F746-Discovery folder.

Temperature measurement can be performed with a small 22k NTC connected to the A0 pin of the Arduino Connector.
The NTC datasheet is in the Doc/ folder. The upper member of the resistive divider is a 22k resistor.
